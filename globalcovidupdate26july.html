          <p>Coronavirus Global Updates: More than 15.87 million people have been reported to be infected by the novel coronavirus globally and 639,354​ have died, according to a Reuters tally. Over the past week, nearly 40 countries have witnessed a record single-day spike in fresh coronavirus infections which is double the number from the previous week. Apart from the countries like the US and Brazil that have larger caseloads, Australia, Hong Kong, Sudan, Uzbekistan, Israel among others saw their highest spike in cases.</p>
        <p>North Korea has reported a suspected covid-19 case in its border town, following which Kim Jong Un decided to impose a lockdown and declare emergency in Kaesong city. If confirmed this would be N. Korea’s first official coronavirus case.

        <p>Meanwhile, in the United States, Texas apart from witnessing a surge in infections is being hit hard by Hurricane Hanna that has made landfall twice and is threatening to bring possible tornadoes.

         <p>Stranded on a tiny Italian island, a cancer researcher grew increasingly alarmed to hear that one, and then three more visitors had fallen ill with COVID-19. Paola Muti braced for a rapid spread of the coronavirus to the 800 closely-knit islanders, many of whom she knows well.

          <p>Her mother was born on Giglio Island and she often stays at the family home with its charming view of the sea through the parlor’s windows. But days passed and none of Giglio’s islanders developed any COVID-19 symptoms even though the conditions seemed favorable for the disease to spread like wildfire.</p>
          <p>Giglio lies in pristine waters in a protected regional marine sanctuary, and the islanders voice relief that they live in a natural environment they like to think is good for health.</p>
